- (WIP) Pattern coverage
- (WIP) Scope check for relation variables
- (WIP) Scope check for rule variables and identifiers
- (WIP) Using only defined constructors
- (WIP) Using only defined relations
- (WIP) Using only defined syntax categories on constructors
- (WIP) Variables and identifiers in a rule or query must not overlap
- (WIP) Constructor type checking
- (WIP) Relation type checking
- (WIP) Check that relations have at least one parameter (the lang is pure, single argument relations are useless aside from log filling)
