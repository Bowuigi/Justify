# Justify

A common exchange format for logical systems expressed in terms of inference rules.

This repo includes the [JSON Type Definition](https://jsontypedef.com) format specifications in `formats/*.jtd.json` files.

The specification is meant to include three formats:

- **System**: The full logical system, including its syntax and logical relations.
- **Query**: A single query to a logical system.
- **DerivationTree**: Derivation trees corresponding to query results, possibly generated by the microKanren implementation in this project.

This project also is meant to contain basic tools:

- A **verifier** (WIP) that checks that the files are correct.
- An **inferencer** (WIP, MVP ready that only outputs a human-readable representation) that takes a System and a Query on it and returns a DerivationTree with the query results.
- Various **extractors** that turn those formats into other formats for external uses.
  - (WIP, MVP ready that extracts from a **System** file) A LaTeX and KaTeX compatible TeX extractor.
- Some way to ease writing those formats.

The subproject folders have separate README files documenting their usage.

## Why?

Understanding how type systems work with just your imagination is complex and error-prone. You either have to guess the types of a program yourself or build another program that does that for you (a typechecker), both of which take a lot of time.

It's meant to be open in order to ease integration with external tools such as theorem provers, code generators, structural editors, etc.
